Consider a modified version of the vacuum environment in Exercise 2.8, in which the
agent is penalized one point for each movement.
b. What about a reflex agent with state? Design such an agent.



. Can a reflex agent with state outperform a simple reflex agent? Design such an agent
and measure its performance on several environments. Can you design a rational agent
of this type?


Can a simple reflex agent with a randomized agent function outperform a simple reflex
agent? Design such an agent and measure its performance on several environments.


Can you design an environment in which your randomized agent will perform poorly?
Show your results.
